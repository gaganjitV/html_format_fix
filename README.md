# html_format_fix

## Description

I was givi e a starter code in html and css. Which was fully functional. The html needed to be fixed. 
It was not folowing the rules of html. For example, its footer and header were divs. The format was wrong.
it did not have any header or footer. Plus, the nav tag was replaced by a div which is wrong. So I fixed
that and added a nav tag. Also the Images tag did not have an alt text which should be there incase the image does not load or
if a disable person is on the page.
